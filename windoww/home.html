<h3 align="center" style="font-family: 'Titillium Web', sans-serif; color:#333333;">Hi, I am Shantanu Johri and I'm an android engineer from India currently based in New Delhi. Apart from playing with Android I'm quite well versed with web & UI/UX development. I dabble around with mostly front-end technologies, always keep up-to-date with the latest products, constantly learning new things and never stop building useful applications for myself and other people.
	I've recently been introduced to Data Science and since then I've been constantly involved in trying fuse Data Science with Android. This is also my personal project and will be commercially available throught the world soon.
	I'm also a startup enthusiast and loves to be challenged. Want to know more about me? Either connect with me through my social channels or we can schedule a talk over a cup of coffee!
