Hi!
<br><br>
I love to build scalable products and have been at it since I learnt to code.<br>
I remember my first ever software release was a Java based client called as 'Lynn' which used to save email templates and helped users to quickly send email by autofilling texts. This was 5 years back.<br><br>

I started my career as a designer, then switched to being a teacher, and an android developer.<br>
Folks at my first organisation were so happy with my progress that they decided to onboard me as a full time employee and from thereon I became more immersed into building products from ground zero.<br>
<br>
So far I have built:<br>
 - Greyplate - (SOLD)<br>
 - Digifynd - (OPERATIONAL)<br>
 - PeakPerformer - (OPERATIONAL and a 20K USD MRR company)<br>
 - Bytemine - (OPERATIONAL and valued at 250K GBP)<br>
<br><br>
From managing remote teams (people from all over the world); to creating designs, mobile apps, and websites. I'm fortunate enough to experience it all.
<br><br>
If you have more questions about me then let's connect over email! sj@bytemine.io
