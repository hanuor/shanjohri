Hi!

I love to build scalable products and have been at it since I learnt to code.
I remember my first ever software release was a Java based client called as 'Lynn' which used to save email templates and helped users to quickly send email by autofilling texts. This was 5 years back.

I started my career as a designer, then switched to being a teacher, and an android developer.
Folks at my first organisation were so happy with my progress that they decided to onboard me as a full time employee and from thereon I became more immersed into building products from ground zero.

So far I have built:
 - Greyplate - (SOLD)
 - Digifynd - (OPERATIONAL)
 - PeakPerformer - (OPERATIONAL and a 20K USD MRR company)
 - Bytemine - (OPERATIONAL and valued at 250K GBP)

From managing remote teams from all of the world to creating designs, mobile apps, and websites. I'm fortunate enough to experience it all.

If you have more questions about me then let's connect over email! sj@bytemine.io
