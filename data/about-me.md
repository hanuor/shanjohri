Hey there! I am thrilled to have you here. I'm a software developer at Internshala and my job is to take care of the website and the android app as well.<br> I fall in love too easily. First there was Android, then came the Neural networks followed by Kotlin and now I'm happily in a realtionship with the art of filmmaking and photography.
