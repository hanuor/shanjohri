<h3 align="center" style="font-family: 'Titillium Web', sans-serif; color:#333333;">Hey there, my name is  Shantanu and I'm by passion an android engineer from India. Apart from playing with Android I like getting my hands dirty with UI/UX and sometimes with web development. I dabble around with mostly front-end technologies, always keep up-to-date with the latest products, constantly learning new things and never stop building stuff that's comes in handy whenever needed.
	I've recently been introduced to Deep Learning/AI and since then I've been constantly involved in trying to fuse it with Android. This is also my personal project and will be commercially available throught the world soon(hopefully - if everything goes right).
	In future I'd like to start something of my own or atleast work for a tech - giant.
  If you want to know more about me just Google me up or we can schedule a talk over a cup of coffee! :)
